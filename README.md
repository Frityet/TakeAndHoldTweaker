# TakeAndHoldTweaker
An H3VR plugin for modifying Take &amp; Hold! Has support for custom characters, as well as global tweaks to spice things up.

## Installation
0. **Make sure you uninstalled older versions of TNHTweaker before continuing**
1. Install the [Deli Mod Loader](https://github.com/Deli-Counter/Deli)
    - Deli requires the x64 version of BepInEx, you can find installation instructions for that [here](https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html?tabs=tabid-win)
    - By default the games root folder path is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3VR
2. Download the **TakeAndHoldTweaker(Unzip Me).zip** from the [releases page](https://github.com/devyndamonster/TakeAndHoldTweaker/releases)
3. Extract that zip file into your H3VR install folder

4. Run H3VR once, and enter the Take &amp; Hold menu scene
    - This may take a while, as it will have to generate a compatible magazines cache
    - This will also generate a config file inside your **Deli/configs** folder
5. Place any character files into the **Deli/mods** folder

## Current Custom Characters

***NOTE:*** All characters can be found in the releases page

- **Comrade Kolbasa** \- A character which can only use russian and czech weaponry
